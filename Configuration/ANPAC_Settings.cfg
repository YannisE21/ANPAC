description: Adjustable settings for the ANPAC system

# General Settings
variable_verbose_enable: True                 # Enable verbose output for debugging purposes (True or False).

# Cooling Settings
variable_cooling_height: 1                    # Z-height of the nozzle (mm) during cooling. Lower values improve cooling by positioning the nozzle closer to the bed.
variable_release_temp: 30                     # Safe bed temperature (Â°C) for moving or removing the print. High temperatures can damage motors!

# Wiping Settings
variable_top_wipe_offset: 20                  # Z-offset (mm) for the first wiping pass. Calculated as print height minus this offset.
variable_bottom_wipe: 1                       # Final wiping Z-height (mm) close to the bed, allowing precise wiping near the surface.

# Retraction Settings
variable_retraction_amount: 5                 # Filament retraction length (mm) before bed clearing, to prevent oozing.

# Placeholder Gcode Section
